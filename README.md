A simple, full-stack web application built with Flask and SQLite3 to manage sales orders and their associated items.
The system allows users to:

**Manage items (sales order lines) within a sales order.
**Search items by ItemCode or ItemName.
**View totals, including the number of items, total quantity, and total price for each sales order.
